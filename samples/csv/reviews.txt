1482	It is not a very cheerful picture	This picture lingers on the sordid miseries in the home of a man who drinks and is brutal when drunk Too many know all about such things The pictures object was to give a broad enough canvas on which to paint the conversion of the drunken father The truth is that fathers who have fallen so low as this seldom very seldom are converted This one after a spree saw his little boy playing house and acting the drunken father just as he had acted it the day before It disgusted him and he promised his wife not to do it again The picture shows that he kept his promise The Biograph players and producers have done much to hold it above petty realism by very praiseworthy art It is not a very cheerful picture  The Moving Picture World December 30 1911
1587	A Very Important Spanish Pioneer Film Director	Many times an entire life once filled with merit and achievement quickly becomes forgotten after just one mishap Thats precisely what happened with film maker Herr Ricardo Baños known primarily today for his pornographic silent films  a minor sin secretly commissioned by His Highness Alfonso XIII of Spain  But certainly before such nonsense occurred Herr Baños had both an interesting and prolific career during the earliest Spanish silent years In these primitive oeuvres Herr Baños skillful inventiveness shines through Keeping in mind the scarce resources of the very early films the quality of his work stands out for what was such a small Spanish Film making industry during that early period  The true merit of Herr Baños work can be seen in Don Pedro El Cruel 1911 in where another Spanish king is involved Herr Pedro of Castile known as Peter the Cruel Here the film is filled with more earthly worries to deal with and solve in comparison with Herr Baños later work  idle and lecherous decadence seen in the flesh films mentioned above The films theatrical nature can be seen at the beginning a historically realistic drama that introduced the actors themselves to the camera during the first minutes followed by  static camera  filmed scenes in a pure theatrical manor of acting and décors But soon after everything changes the action takes place in an outdoor setting where can be seen some mediumlength shots careful art direction and a solid cinematographic continuity for the parameters of such an early time certifying Herr Baños true artistic concern for his work Unfortunately the second reel is missing so we cannot completely appreciate Herr Bañoss skillful inventiveness at its full length although you can certainly know what happened with Herr Peter of Castile and the conspiracy against him by his three bastard brothers  if you have a dusty reference library at hand  In spite of such inconvenience the surviving reel has enough remarkable film achievement to restore to Herr Baños his lost silent honor as a very important Spanish pioneer film director and not simply the one who  in a moment of weakness  once directed some little pornographic films And now if youll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must conspire against one of his Teutonic rich heiresses Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzienblogspotcom
1592	Turgid soap opera in early Danish	I saw this Danish silent film in October 2006 at the Cinema Muto festival in Sacile Italy Its title doesnt readily translate into English I would render it as Expediency Edgar Geheimraaden is a wealthy young man who meets a beautiful shopgirl named Ebba and they straight away fall in love They begin to date and three months later Ebba is pregnant Up until this point Edgar has shown no interest in marrying Ebba but now he starts planning their wedding with surprising alacrity Will they go on an EbbaDebba honeymoon When his parents learn of Edgars plans his father persuades him not to go ahead  because of the class differences between Edgar and Ebba of course Hoping that Edgar will forget about Ebba his father sends the young swain to live with his the fathers rural friends the Laege family Indeed the Laeges also have an attractive young daughter Lily SPOILERS AHEAD When Edgar confides in Lily she persuades him to write to Ebba through the intermediary of Ebbas employer the shopkeeper  although at this point Ebbas pregnancy is too far advanced for her to keep her job Edgars father contrives to intercept the letters Believing that Edgar does not care about her Ebba gives birth to her child  then dies in hospital When Edgar and Lily learn this they plan to marry and adopt the child Zanny Petersen the brunette actress who portrays Lily is quite attractive but her complexion is surprisingly dark more surprisingly since shes a Scandinavian I kept thinking perhaps she was wearing too much makeup Ekspeditricen is a turgid slice of soap opera which reveals the morals of its time yet also hypocritically manages to have its Danish pastry and eat it too Edgar impregnates a workingclass woman and goes merrily on his way  yet he also manages to take responsibility for the child without marrying beneath his station Lily is of a higher social class than Ebba The films attitude towards Ebba seems to be that the dirty slut had sex without getting married so she deserves to die in poverty I was intrigued by this films too few exterior shots for the glimpses they gave me of Danish scenery in 1911 but I found this movies story and the actors histrionics quite depressing This is so far the earliest film Ive seen which uses the cinematic device of an insert shot of a newspaper article Mostly for its historic value Ill rate this one 4 out of 10 The movies director August Blom made better and more significant films during this same period
1892	Genre Case	Ive seen a few Danish silent films from the 1910s now and it seems many of them if not most of them are pretty much the same Theyre sensational melodramas involving a tragic woman vamp or femme fatal type character in addition to the good guy and the bad guy And theres usually a circus involved This film The Black Dream contains all of that I find it interesting to compare these films as a genre study The Black Dream is a weak entry The two stars of this one Asta Nielsen and Valdemar Psilander made similar films during their careers They seem to overact more than usual here The camera is static as usual then although the scene dissection is decent for 1911 There are some noticeable moments of unpolished filmmaking One scene I think actually ends a second or two after the director had called cut Overall the film dawdles One thing to look for though the use of a mirror in one scene to show action otherwise out of frame This idea was taken further by August Bloom in another film from 1911 Temptations of a Great City Ved Fængslets Port
1892	A Melodrama From The Teens Of The 20th Century	In the film Den Sorte Drom three of the most important people of Danish filmmaking were reunited  the great actress Asta Nielsen the handsome fellow Valdemar Psilander and the worthy film director Urban Gad This is a film that efficiently relates the story of Damen Stella a horsewoman who performs in a circus and who arise great passion in men Due to her charms Damen Stella will be wooed by two admirers  an old jeweler and a young Count Damen Stella finally chooses the second one an act that means that the horsewoman has a lot of horse sense The choice based upon love still immediately causes jealousy and suspicions between the two lovers It becomes the cause of many disputes which are decided finally when all arguments are settled by the playing of a card duel between the two suitors MEIN GOTT what happened with the duels at dawn in misty sceneries theres something rotten in Denmark indeed  The young Count loses the play and has to pay a high amount of money that he doesnt have ah the complicated economic situation of the aristocracy  to the jeweler and at once Obscure dealings will arise between the horsewoman the jeweler and the Count Central in this is a necklace a jewel that will be finally be the cause of a tragic ending in this special love triangle Herr Urban Gad directed the film as always in an efficient and accurate way for a film characteristic of a melodrama from the teens of the 20th century Gad got the help of a larger than life Damen Nielsen and even with Herr Psilander just playing Herr Psilander As a curiosity at the end of a torrid love scene between the horsewoman and the Count it is possible to be see how the actors cut the scene in a humorous way a kind of false shot that it wasnt eliminated in the film And now if youll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count has to review the jewel case of my German fat fräulein in order to survey its content lest there is some lacking Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzienblogspotcom
1892	An eye opener	All four films made by Asta Nielsen in Denmark in 1910 1911 and 1919  before she became an international superstar have been released by the Danish Film Institute which was created a hundred years ago and has taken care of Danish films ever since Thus we usually get very good clean and sharp copies of films almost 100 years old The series is truly amazing and the Asta Nielsen disk is one of the best The four features on one disk are Livets storme Afrgrunden Den sorte drøm and Mod Lyset I had only seen Asta Nielsens later films such as Hamlet before therefore I was astounded to see that she was a rather beautiful actress in her youth with a figure of a Barbie doll which she isnt afraid to show The films are remarkably good as well In Afgrunden we see Miss Nielsen as a shy piano teacher who abandons her fiancée in order to elope with a circus artist who turns her into a harlot and a murderess in Livets storme she is a dancer whose beauty brings along the ruin of her and of men in Den sorte drom she is a circus star who does everything for the man she loves and in Mod Lyset a reckless countess who has to destroy the lives of several men as well as her own before she learns the true values of life The last tale is a bit moralizing for modern tastes but the first three from 19101911 are true gems These films are naturalistic strong portraits of life before the WW I Miss Nielsen is a very good actress indeed as well as a gorgeous clothes horse wearing the trendiest models of the day around her nonexistent waist The prints are very sharp even though the first film shows some decomposition They should have been released colour tinted and with somewhat more interesting musical accompaniment than the constantly meditating piano but who cares These films still were eye openers When you thought the film wasnt a true art form back in 1910 think again moving camera panning camera closeups parallel editing fluent narrative  its all there and years before these techniques became accepted in UK US or Italy
1892	It is tough to like the good guys	Den sorte drøm or The Black Dream or Der schwarze Traum is a GermanDanish coproduction from 105 years ago Obviously this is still a blackandwhite film and silent as well of course I cannot say I have heard of the two male lead actors but Asta Nielsen was one of the most famous European actress in the 1910s and 1920 Sadly she did not make the transition to sound films As for this one here it is not really a love triangle as it becomes clear very quickly which guy she wants but instead it takes us on a ruthless journey into the abysses of the human soul And the good guys are in it tooOf course it is easy to like the bad guy even if you could also feel sorry for him but the good ones steal gamble and do something that is almost prostitution and results in a deadly ending All in all this 53minute film written and directed by Urban Gad is really overly dramatic and sacrifices credibility and realism for that unfortunately Plus as usual this one needed way more intertitles Not one of the better silent movies Thumbs down
1964	Patriotism Trumps Love	Frau Yvonne  Frau Asta Nielsen   daughter of a rich and French noble family  falls in love with a young Prussian Lieutenant  Herr Robert Valberg  this proves to be a tormented and complicated relationship due to the sense of duty of the Prussian Lieutenant and the whimsical imprudence of the young bourgeois Danish film director Herr Urban Gad and Danish silent star Frau Asta Nielsen were husband and wife and worked together in many films during the 10s of the last century unfortunately when WWI ended so did their marriage but their respective careers continued to thrive During their harmonized careers both worked together in many notable early German films Die Verräterin  The Traitress  has many characteristics of the GadNielsen collaborations  particularly in the presence of a strong female lead In his German films Herr Gad built the dramatic intensity of the story until it reached a crescendo and a powerful closing act was characteristic of his style Although this may not seem noteworthy to modernen eyes one should remember that at this point in time 1911 films were often no more than simple vignettes static and lacking in pace and with very unimaginative cinematography And Herr Graf also wishes to say that female characters in the early 10s films were often minor or unimportant but Frau Nielsen from the very start of her career played independent and strong willed women Die Verräterin is a good example of a typical Frau Nielsen role She is a frivolous bourgeois fräulein with an overbearing personality who cant understand why the young Prussian lieutenant puts duty before passion Ultimately she will even flirt with the partisans  the historical background is the 187071 GermanFrench war  and ends up betraying her lover with terrible and tragic results Frau Nielsens performance captures the contradictions whims and the love and hate duality of her character and is perfectly matched by Herr Urbans dramatic construction of the story in which patriotism trumps love and has the final word And now if youll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must betray his own aristocratic convictions Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzienblogspotcom
2101	Fascinating rediscovery	Im amazed to see a 1912 feature thats almost 90 minutes long By contrast From the Manger to the Cross is under 70 min The tinting and restoration are good the modern music by Chantal Kreviazuk is interesting if unnecessary theres no reason to be turned off by ityou can always play your own music The film is not in pure tableau style but in modified tableaus That is there is some crosscutting from different locations and dialogue cards do interrupt the shots The first scene is even somewhat distracting in its cutaways to a man who is a short distance away During the battle of Actium the camera suddenly goes in for a series of near closeups of Cleopatra and Antony from the waist up and the entire scene is told in these alternating shots with captions A way to avoid staging a battle The scene in which she barges down the Nile and seduces Antony is a typical example of film dart tableau style with only dialogue interrupting the shot occasionally The major lengthy sequence at the end however begins in two locations in Cleos chamber on an upper floor and outside on the ground below and Antony is raised up through the window on a rope then for the rest of the complex scene the camera pans right and left as called for by the action Fascinating and typically noble
2101	Early version of The Nights of Cleopatra	This early silent 1912 is a bit creeky canvas flats that move in the breeze and a ship pushed on from the wings but is an early attempt to use ancient history as the inspiration for a film drama Helen Gardner and her troupe filmed a stage production typical for the time with little awareness of the possibilities of the medium The plot actually comes from another source than Shakespeare and is not the usual Anthony and Cleopatra story It may be based on a French 19th century opera which in turn can be traced back to a short story by Alexander Pushkin This film is an excellent example of the state of the art in the time that it was made
